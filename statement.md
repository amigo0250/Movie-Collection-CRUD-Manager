# Project Statement

This project is a basic Python program that performs CRUD operations on a movie collection.  
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

The program allows the user to:

1. Add a new movie by entering its name, year, and rating.
2. View the list of all movies stored in the program.
3. Update the details of any existing movie.
4. Delete a movie from the list.
5. Exit the program.

The data is stored in a Python list using dictionaries.  
The program uses simple functions, loops, and user input to manage the movie collection.

This project was created to practice basic Python concepts such as:
- Lists and dictionaries
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Input/Output in the console

The project runs entirely in the terminal and does not require any external libraries.
